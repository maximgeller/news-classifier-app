                <h3>What is this thing?!</h3>
                <p>Scary machine learning ðŸ˜²...just kidding. This is an application that takes in any news article you want and classifies
                it as real or not. Keep in mind though, it really is just a <b>guess</b>. The model vectorizes all of the words it's presented and 
                computes the probability that the news article is true using something called a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes classifier</a>!

                <h3>Why did we make this?</h3>
                <p>This website was built as a project to learn about deploying machine learning models and web development.
                <br />The inspiration came from two projects on <a href="https://enlight.nyc">Enlight</a>, the educational platform where
                anyone can learn to code by building real projects. This is an extension of two projects from the website, the 
                <a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/build-a-naive-bayes-classifier">Naive Bayes classifier</a> and 
                <a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/build-a-flask-web-app">Flask web app</a>.</p><br>
