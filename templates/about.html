                <h3>What is this thing?!</h3>
                <p>Scary machine learning ðŸ˜²...just kidding. This is an application that takes in any news article you want and classifies
                it as real or not. Keep in mind though, this model should <b>never</b> get the final say. The model vectorizes all of the words it's presented and 
                computes the probability that the news article is true using something called a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Naive Bayes classifier</a>!

                <h3>What is "fake news"?</h3>
                <p><blockquote><em>"...fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent.
                  Fake-news outlets, in turn, lack the news media's editorial norms and processes for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of
                  information. Fake news overlaps with other information disorders, such as misinformation (false or misleading information) 
                  and disinformation (false information that is purposely spread to deceive people)."</em><br><br>

                  </blockquote>
                  To sum that up, fake news are stories which are meant to <b>disinform</b> the reader. One of the motivations behind this project
                  was to see if we could find a way to identify patterns in news stories that suggest the probability that they're untrue.

                <h3>Why did we make this?</h3>
                <p>This website was built as a project to learn about deploying machine learning models and web development.
                <br />The inspiration came from two projects on <a href="https://enlight.nyc">Enlight</a>, the educational platform where
                anyone can learn to code by building real projects. This is an extension of two projects from the website, the 
                <a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/build-a-naive-bayes-classifier">Naive Bayes classifier</a> and 
                <a href="https://enlight.nyc/projects/build-a-flask-web-app">Flask web app</a>.</p><br>

                <p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/maximgeller/projects/tree/master/fake_news_naive_bayes">link</a> 
                to the notebook where the model is trained! Also, the training data came from this 
                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/">dataset</a> on Kaggle.
                <br>Finally, the source code to this full web application can be found
